	\brief Contains and manages a UTF-8 string

	This class inherits the STL std::string class.  The std::string class can hold UTF-8 strings, but it becomes
	difficult to conduct any string operations on the UTF-8 string because UTF-8 has variable-length characters.
	The std::string class is best suited for fixed-length ASCII strings, hence why we need a separate class for
	UTF-8 strings.  When accessing individual characters in a Utf8String, Utf8Char objects will be returned.
	A Utf8Char object contains a single UTF-8 character (also known as a code point) and the individual code
	units representing the UTF-8 character can be accessed if desired.

	Endianness does not affect the UTF-8 string class. It stores the string as a sequence of 8-bit code units,
	which are unaffected by endianness.
