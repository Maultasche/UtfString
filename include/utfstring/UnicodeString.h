TODO: References can be assigned using the = operator when they are first initialized, but assigning
a reference (as opposed to assigning the value of another reference) after that pount must be done
using assign_reference().  If an invalid reference (usually a reference to a string that has been
changed) is assigned to using the = operator, you will get a crash.

TODO: What happens when iterators from two different strings are compared using ==, !=, <, <=, >, >=?
When both are from the same string type (Utf8String)?  When they are from two different string types?

TODO: Insert section into documentation talking about how postfix operators for iterators take a little longer
and use more memory (because a copy of the iterator is made) than prefix operators.  If you have a choice,
it's always better to use the "+=" operator rather than the "+" operator and the "-=" operator rather than
the "-" operator, because the "+" and "-" operators create copies of an iterator, which has an effect on
memory and speed.

However, unless memory is scarce or speed is critical, you shouldn't need worry about these differences,
because it's a usually a very small difference on modern computers.  It may make a difference on a 
normal PC if you are doing millions of increments/decrements a second, but if you're not, don't worry 
too much about it.

TODO: UnicodeString is a wrapper class, and wraps UTF-8 or UTF-16 strings.  As a result, other string
types (char*, std::string, wchar_t*, etc.) have to be encapsulated in a Utf8String or Utf16String
object before they can be assigned to a UnicodeString or used in many of UnicodeString's member functions.

TODO: Dereferencing a UnicodeString iterator will get you a UnicodeCharReference, or a UnicodeChar if the
iterator is a constant iterator. Since UnicodeCharReference and UnicodeChar are encoding-neutral, you can 
only get the code point (UTF-32) value.  If you want to access the code units, you will have to cast the
UnicodeCharReference or UnicodeChar to a its encoding equivalent (Utf8Char, Utf16Char)

TODO: A UnicodeCharReference cannot be cast to a Utf8CharReference or Utf16CharReference because

	\brief Contains and manages an encoding-neutral Unicode string

	This class is intended to be used in situations when the encoding of a Unicode string
	is unknown at compile time.  UnicodeString encapsulates and encoding-specific string,
	and abstracts away code units, concentrating on code points instead.

	UnicodeString is less efficient than the encoding-specific string classes (Utf8String 
	and Utf16String), and due to the need to be encoding-neutral, contains less functionality
	than the encoding-specific strings.  If you won't know the exact encoding until runtime,
	use UnicodeString; otherwise, use Utf8String or Utf16String.

	A UnicodeString can always be converted to a Utf8String or Utf16String. So if a string
	is coming from a source with an unknown encoding, such as a file, use UnicodeString at
	first and then convert to a Utf8String or Utf16String for use in the rest of the 
	application.  UnicodeString is most useful in library APIs or any other widely-used code,
	so functions can return a UnicodeString object instead of implementing separate functions
	for each encoding.
