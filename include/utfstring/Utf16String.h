	\brief Contains and manages a UTF-16 string

	This class inherits the STL wstring class.  The wstring class can hold UTF-16 strings, but it becomes
	difficult to conduct any string operations on the UTF-16 string because UTF-16 has variable-length characters.
	The wstring class is best suited for fixed-length UCS-2 strings, hence why we need a separate class for
	UTF-16 strings.  When accessing individual characters in a Utf16String, wstring objects will be returned.
	In the vast majority of cases, the wstring will contain a character consisting of a single 16-bit code unit, but in
	some instances will contain two 16-bit code units.

	Using Utf16String is generally advised when dealing with UTF-16 files or when you know that you will be dealing
	with characters beyond the basic multilingual plane.  If you won't be using characters beyond the basic
	multilingual plane, which is mostly populated by code points for use by Asian languages, then the fixed-width
	wstring class will probably suffice.

	Endianness does not affect the UTF-16 string class. It stores the string as a sequence of 16-bit code units,
	and C++ abstracts the endianness of a particular code unit.  The endianness would become important only if
	this string was directly converted into a sequence of bytes, where C++ would no longer be able to abstract
	the byte order.

		This function has a O(N) performance, since we need to iterate through the code units to figure
		out how many code points there are.  Counting each code point is an extremely quick operation, but
