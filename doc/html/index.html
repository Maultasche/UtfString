Introduction</h1>
<p>The UtfString Library is a C++ library containing classes to manage Unicode strings, specifically UTF-8 and UTF-16 encoded strings. UtfString is intended to be a small, fast library containing functionality for storing, converting, and manipulating UTF-8 and UTF-16 strings. UtfString is also intended to be a cross-platform library; the library is primarily targeted at Windows, OS X, and Linux platforms, but is designed to make it easy to port to other platforms as well.</p>
<p>The UtfString library came into being because it was very difficult to find a small, standalone, cross-platform, and easy-to-use C++ library that handled both UTF-8 and UTF-16 strings. There were plenty of Unicode string libraries out there, some of them quite good, but they were either rather large (<a href="http://www.icu-project.org/">ICU</a>), tightly coupled with another library (<a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/docs/api/html/classOgre_1_1UTFString.html">OGRE</a>, <a href="http://www.gtkmm.org/docs/glibmm-2.4/docs/reference/html/classGlib_1_1ustring.html">GTKmm</a>), intended for a single platform (Win32 API), provided an incomplete implementation (UTF-8 only or fixed-width UTF-16), or were simply obtuse and difficult to figure out. UtfString was designed to solve these issues.</p>
<p>UtfString is not a catch-all solution. It is intended to store, convert, and manipulate UTF-8 and UTF-16 strings, but it knows nothing about locales or languages. It is unaware of any language- or locale-specific rules; rather, it is intended to be a language- and locale-neutral Unicode string library. When a complete locale- and language-aware solution is required, the <a href="http://www.icu-project.org/">ICU</a> library would be the best library to use. The ICU library and all its locale data, however, is comparatively large (around 20 MB), hence the need for something smaller for those projects that don't need all that extra functionality. UtfString is intended to be small and efficient, able to fulfill most Unicode needs on multiple platforms.</p>
<p>The interface for the classes in the UtfString library should be familiar, since it is very similar to the STL string classes. Most of the functions in the STL string classes also exist in the UtfString classes. The <a class="el" href="struct_utf_string_1_1_utf8_string.html">Utf8String </a> and <a class="el" href="struct_utf_string_1_1_utf16_string.html">Utf16String </a> classes allow the user to ignore code units and think in terms of characters. However, both the <a class="el" href="struct_utf_string_1_1_utf8_string.html">Utf8String </a> and <a class="el" href="struct_utf_string_1_1_utf16_string.html">Utf16String </a> classes can be cast as STL strings (std::string for Utf8String and std::basic_string&lt;UInt16&gt; Utf16String), so as to make their underlying code units easy to access, should the programmer desire that.</p>
<p>A UTF-32 string class has not been implemented by UtfString, since not only is there is currently little need for it, there are no existing code points requiring multiple UTF-32 code units, resulting in UTF-32 characters always being fixed width. A UTF-32 string class containing fixed-width characters would be easy to create, particularly using the C++ Standard Template Library's basic_string&lt;&gt; class.</p>
<p>You can either go from here to look at the UtfString <a href="annotated.html" class="el">Class Reference</a>, or the UtfString <a class="el" href="page_tutorial.html">Tutorial</a>, which explains in more detail how to use this library and gives background information about Unicode and the UTF encodings. In addition, you can look at the <a class="el" href="page_designimploverview.html">Design and Implementation Overview</a> to read about some of the library design and implementation details.</p>
