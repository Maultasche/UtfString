<div class="textblock"><p>The developer's notes is a section where I discuss issues surrounding the UtfString project and any issues you may encounter while making changes to the UtfString library.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="section_crossplatform"></a>
Cross-Platform Functionality</h1>
<p>The UtfString library is intended to be a cross-platform library. I'm only interested in developing for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X, but UtfString will likely be able to run on other platforms as well. If you would like submit any contributions so that UtfString will build and run on other platforms, or even test how well UtfString works on a particular platform, please do so. See the section on <a class="el" href="page_developersnotes.html#section_contributing">contributing to the</a> UtfString project".</p>
<p><b>Windows - Visual Studio 2005</b></p>
<p>The majority of my experience has been developing on Visual Studio under Windows, so that is the compiler and platform that has the most support.</p>
<p><b>Windows - Visual Studio 2003 and .NET</b></p>
<p>You should be able to build UtfString under Visual Studio 2003 and .NET ( using &lt;a href="http://www.stlport.org/" STLPort) in a similar manner as when building with Visual Studio 2005. I have not, however, tried to do so. If you care to try, I would appreciate any feedback on how it went, including <a class="el" href="page_developersnotes.html#section_contributing">contributions</a> to the build and usage instructions in this documentation.</p>
<p><b>Windows - Dev-C++</b></p>
<p>Since I have little experience with Dev-C++ and I do not use it to develop, UtfString has very little testing on this IDE. Since Dev-C++ uses MinGW, which is based on the gcc compiler, and I've been been able to successfully build and test UtfString on Linux using gcc, it's quite likely that UtfString will work just fine when compiled with MinGW and any IDE that uses MinGW.</p>
<p>I welcome any feedback about anyone who is using UtfString and developing with Dev-C++ as well as any <a class="el" href="page_developersnotes.html#section_contributing">contributions</a> to the build and usage instructions in this documentation.</p>
<p><b>Windows - MinGW</b></p>
<p>Although I have used gcc on Unix-type operating systems, I have no experience using MinGW under Windows. If anyone would like to set up a MinGW build environment and <a class="el" href="page_developersnotes.html#section_contributing">contribute</a> to this project, I would appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Linux - Autotools</b></p>
<p>I've written makefiles and developed smaller programs with gcc as the compiler on Unix-type operating systems in the past, so I'm familiar with developing on non-Windows platforms. However, before I started this project, I had never developed on Linux, and I was not at all familiar with the GNU autotools (autoconf and automake), which are used to build many of the libraries and applications on Linux. Once I had UtfString building under Windows, I set out to get UtfString working on Linux using autoconf and automake.</p>
<p>It took quite a lot of time to figure out enough to get UtfString building with the autotools (good tutorials are hard to find), but I finally succeeded. There is very little information about standards for Linux development (if indeed there are any), so I'm not entirely sure that I'm doing it correctly. Currently, the autotools will create a makefile that builds UtfString with debug symbols (there appears to be no way around that). Installing the built library using the standard "make install" installs it with debug symbols. The user has to explicitly install using "make install-strip" to install the library without debug symbols. Ideally, I would like to have the default use no debug symbols and add an option to include debug symbols when someone is using the library for development. I haven't been able to figure how to do this and I don't if installing libraries with debug symbols is the standard way of installing or not.</p>
<p>In addition, I still need to create some autoconf macros so that developers can easily add UtfString to their projects. I have a feeling that this is not going to be easy, since I am not at all familiar with M4 or the available environment variables.</p>
<p>I would really appreciate it if any of you more experienced Linux developers gave me feedback on the Linux build process or made any <a class="el" href="page_developersnotes.html#section_contributing">contributions</a> to the Linux build process.</p>
<p><b>Mac OS X - Autotools</b></p>
<p>Presumably, UtfString will build just as well as under Mac OS X using the GNU autotools as under Linux, but I haven't been able to test this to the lack of access to a Mac.</p>
<p>If anyone can test UtfString autotools build process on Mac OS X and let me know how well it works, I would appreciated it.</p>
<p><b>Mac OS X - XCode</b></p>
<p>I plan to eventually get UtfString working with XCode, but this has not yet been done.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="section_developmentissues"></a>
Development Issues</h1>
<p>In this section, we cover issues you may encounter when making changes or additions to the UtfString code.</p>
<p>When making changes to UtfString, I strongly recommend that you use the UtfString unit tests that are included with the library. You can change the tests to test any changes or additions you made, which is very useful for finding bugs in the code. The unit tests, however, are only as good as the effort you put into it. Lazy test code will probably not catch as many errors as well-thought-out test code. It's best to try to consider the different ways it may possibly fail and test for those even though you know the tests will pass. You should also be aware that you are not only testing for changes now, but changes in the future. Your functionality may work just fine now, but future changes may cause it to fail. So it may not be possible that the functionality you implemented fails now in a particular way, but changes in the future may cause it to fail, even changes in seemingly unrelated parts of the library.</p>
<p>Tests are only written once, and run many times. This makes it very easy to not only test the functionality you are working on, but to run regression tests on all the functionality that you aren't working on. You may find that a change makes your functionality work, but breaks something that was previously working just fine.</p>
<p>If you are using the UtfString unit test solution in Visual Studio (although this may possibly apply to other build environments and platforms), you will need to be aware of behavior that may cause confusion. The UtfStringUnitTests project has a post-build step that copies the UtfString dll into the test/bin directory so that the unit tests can be run. This build step, however, only happens when the unit tests need to be built. If you have made a code change to the UtfString library, but you haven't made any changes to the unit test code, you will not see the new changes when running the unit tests. The unit test project will see that it hasn't been updated, so it won't build. If the unit test project doesn't build, it won't run the build step that copies the dll into the test/bin directory. I solve this problem by rebuilding both the library and unit tests project ("Rebuild Solution" in Visual Studio). This forces the post-build step to be run. This is convenient for me because rebuilding both projects is fast. If this is too slow for you, you may want to do something like creating a script to copy the dll to the test/bin directory.</p>
<p>The code in UtfString uses tabs instead of spaces, and I normally view the source files with a tab spacing of 4.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="section_fixesimprovements"></a>
Future Fixes and Improvements</h1>
<p>These are the things that I am considering fixing or improving in UtfString</p>
<ul>
<li>
Improve the Linux build process (see Linux platform under <a class="el" href="page_developersnotes.html#section_crossplatform">Cross-Platform Functionality</a> section) </li>
<li>
Create autoconf macros so that developers can easily use the UtfString library when building applications with autotools. </li>
<li>
Create packages for easy deployment of UtfString on Linux </li>
<li>
Get UtfString to build and run with gcc and XCode on Mac OS X (see Mac OS X platform under <a class="el" href="page_developersnotes.html#section_crossplatform">Cross-Platform Functionality</a> section) </li>
<li>
If there is enough demand for it, I may implement a string class that is encoding-independent, so that someone using UtfString can freely manipulate both UTF-8 and UTF-16 string using the same class. This will be slightly less efficient than using the Utf8String or Utf16String classes directly. I'm expecting that most programmers will use only one encoding on a regular basis in their applications, but I can certainly imagine that some applications (or libraries that don't want to provide two different interfaces) may certainly want to be able to handle multiple encodings in an encoding-neutral way. </li>
</ul>

Contributing to UtfString</h1>
<p>I welcome contributions to this project. Currently, I need people to use UtfString for their own projects and let me know how it is working for them. Bug reports and suggested improvements are welcome. What I especially need are contributions to the build system under Linux and other platforms that I have not used extensively. Automake improvements are welcome as is assistance on building an rpm or Debian package.</p>
